        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Cordon Bleu is a French term, literally translated as 'blue ribbon', that originally referred to an award for culinary excellence given to women cooks!
            The term can now apply to any <br>superior cook (yes, men too), and also to this dish (chicken, ham and Swiss cheese slices, breaded and sauteed). This yummy version adds paprika and a creamy white wine sauce
            <br>worthy of its own blue ribbon. Two blue ribbon tastes in wedded bliss -- Chicken Cordon Bleu!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breasts halves</li>
            <li>6 slices Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>6 slices ham</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pound chicken breasts if they are too thick. Place a cheese and ham slice on each breast within 1/2 inch of the edges. Fold the edges of the chicken over the filling, 
                <br>and secure with toothpicks. Mix the flour and paprika in a small bowl, and coat the chicken pieces.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the chicken until browned on all sides. Add the wine and bouillon. Reduce heat to low, cover, and 
                <br>simmer for 30 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.            </li>
            <li>Remove the toothpicks, and transfer the breasts to a warm platter. Blend the cornstarch with the cream in a small bowl, and whisk slowly into the skillet. Cook, stirring 
                <br>until thickened, and pour over the chicken. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
